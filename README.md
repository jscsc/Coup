# Coup Stick

## Technologies Used:
C++, SFML, Visual Studio 2015

## Description:
Coup Stick (codename Coups) is a board game I designed in Lee Hall at North Carolina State University back in 2015. In June of 2017 I implemented it with a simple AI combatant in C++ using the SFML Library.

The goal of the game is to get as many game pieces as possible to the other side of the game board. Each round, the player may use a pool of 4 points to choose different abilities to help maneuver the board, and destroy enemy game pieces.
